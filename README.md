# MCP DuckDB Server with Streaming Support

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation with DuckDB integration and real-time streaming capabilities using StreamableHTTPServerTransport.

## Overview

This project implements a production-ready MCP server that provides database query capabilities through a `dbQueryTool`. The server streams query results in real-time chunks of 5 rows (with a 1-second delay between chunks), making it ideal for handling large datasets efficiently and for LLM/agent demos.

## Features

- üöÄ **StreamableHTTPServerTransport**: Modern MCP transport with HTTP-based streaming
- üóÑÔ∏è **DuckDB Integration**: In-memory database with CSV data loading
- üìä **Real-time Streaming**: Query results delivered in 5-row chunks (with 1-second delay)
- üîí **Security**: SQL validation (SELECT only) with injection protection
- ‚ö° **TypeScript**: Full type safety with modern Node.js support
- üìà **Scalable**: Handles large datasets without memory issues

curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test schema endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/schema

# Test streaming behavior
npm run test:streaming
```

### Expected Streaming Behavior

For a query returning 25 rows:

1. **Event 1**: `query_start` with metadata
2. **Event 2**: `data_chunk` with rows 1-5 (after 1s delay)
3. **Event 3**: `data_chunk` with rows 6-10 (after 1s delay)
4. **Event 4**: `data_chunk` with rows 11-15 (after 1s delay)
5. **Event 5**: `data_chunk` with rows 16-20 (after 1s delay)
6. **Event 6**: `data_chunk` with rows 21-25 (after 1s delay)
7. **Event 7**: `query_complete` with summary

## LLM Integration Guide

### Perfect for AI Assistants

This MCP server is designed to showcase how LLMs can interact with structured data through natural language. The rich dataset enables complex analytical conversations.

### Demo Script for LLMs

1. **Start with basics**: _"How many employees do we have?"_
2. **Explore departments**: _"What's the breakdown by department?"_
3. **Dive into salaries**: _"Show me salary ranges by department"_
4. **Career progression**: _"Who needs promotions?"_
5. **Remote work analysis**: _"How does remote work vary by location?"_
6. **Advanced insights**: _"Find potential flight risks"_

### Sample LLM Conversation Flow

```
Human: "Show me our highest paid employees"

LLM: I'll query the employee database to find the highest paid employees.

[Calls dbQueryTool with: SELECT employeeName, position, salary, department, location
FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10]

The highest paid employees are:
1. Charles Wilson - VP Engineering ($155,000) - Texas
2. Steven Martin - VP Engineering ($152,000) - California
3. Daniel White - VP Engineering ($150,000) - Washington
4. Helen Rodriguez - VP Engineering ($149,000) - Massachusetts
5. Matthew Garcia - VP Sales ($148,000) - Texas
Human: "Who is ready for promotion?"
LLM: Let me check for employees who are due for promotion based on their last promotion date and tenure.

[Complex promotion analysis query...]

Found 12 employees ready for promotion:
- High Priority: Michael Brown (Software Engineer, 3+ years, never promoted)
- Medium Priority: Angela Reed (Senior SWE, promoted 2+ years ago)
```

### Key Demo Features

- **Rich dataset**: 70 employees with 9 columns of realistic data
- **Natural conversations**: Complex queries from simple questions
- **Real-time streaming**: 5-row chunks with 1-second delays
- **Career insights**: Promotion analysis, salary trends, remote work patterns
- **Multi-dimensional**: Location, department, tenure, salary, promotion data
